# ComfyUI-RenderRiftNodes

## Description
Hey everyone! I've whipped up a cool little node pack for ComfyUI. It's just a few nodes I made for myself, but I think they're pretty neat. We've got three main players here. First, there’s the Custom Output Folder String Generator for keeping your files tidy. Next, the LoadImageWithMetadata node – it’s a real game changer because it lets you pull up image metadata, which is perfect for the third node, the Image Metadata Overlay Node. This one lets you overlay that metadata right onto your images. LoadImageWithMetadata was actually made specifically to get the Metadata Overlay Node working.
